This is a Higher Lower Game.

The Higher Lower Game is a simple yet addictive guessing game where players are presented with pairs of items, such as celebrities, movies, or countries, and they must guess which item has a higher or lower value based on a given criterion. Typically, the criterion could be anything from the number of Instagram followers, box office earnings, population size, or any other quantifiable metric.
Players are presented with two options and must decide whether the first option has a higher or lower value compared to the second option. After making their choice, the game reveals the correct answer along with the actual values of each option. Players can then continue to the next pair and try to beat their own or others' high scores.
